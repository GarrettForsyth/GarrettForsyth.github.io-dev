        <div class="about-me">
          <p>
            I am an aspiring software developer located in the Waterloo region, ON. I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a degree in honours physics, specializing in astrophysics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always been impressed by the power of software to solve seemingly impossible problems. Its power and opportunity captivated me, so I decided to set out to master it myself. What I found was an entire new world.
          </p>
          <p>
          My training in physics left me with skills in research and technical sophistication, which I harnessed to teach myself software development. I spend much of my free time reading about software, following online courses through resources such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and <a href="https://www.saylor.org/">Saylor Academy</a>, and then reinforcing these concepts with assignments and projects (many of which can be found <a href="https://github.com/GarrettForsyth">my github</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most attractive things about software development, is the power to make your creations easily accessible to a large amount of people. With the right idea and execution, you can really make an impact in people's lives. I find great meaning in that, and it's my goal to put myself in a position where my work and ideas can help people.

      <p>
        In my free time I like to keep active. I enjoy any kind of physical activity, especially if it's outside. Currently I'm playing on 3 slow pitch teams! I also like to lift weights, especially during the winter when it's a little harder to find things to do outside!
      </p>

      <p>
        I love games, puzzles and challenges in general. My game of choice is chess. I've been playing since I was 6 and have had many successes on the way, including being the Twin City Champion twice!
      </p>

      <p>
        I read often. When it's for pleasure I read the classics. My favourite author is Dostoevsky. When it comes to movies I enjoy scifi and fantasy. In general I'll appreciate any book for film that has an imaginative story.
